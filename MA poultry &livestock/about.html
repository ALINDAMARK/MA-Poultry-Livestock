            <h1>Who We Are</h1>
            <p>MA POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK was founded in 2009 as a poultry breeder farm and has grown steadily 
              over the years to establish itself as one of the best- known brands in the Ugandan poultry 
              industry. We are now the leading supplier of day-old chicks and poultry feeds and other related
              Livestock in the country. We have recently started producing other livestock feeds such as dairy
              and pig feeds. A commercial broiler farm was set up in 2016 which is now in full production.
              MA POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK is a small group of farmers based in Uganda that started as a hobby
              has now spiraled to a thriving popular enterprise. We started keeping poultry of our own for
              years now, like many poultry keepers our first chickens were ex battery hens, but it wasnâ€™t
              long before we fancied keeping some pure breeds and from then on there was no looking back,
              the showing bug had bitten. From humble beginnings in 1990, we built our business upon the 
              sale of few boar goats, chickens and eggs to our neighbors and family members. Today MA POULTRY
              AND LIVESTOCK is still proudly a family owned and led company. From a few chickens and boar 
              goats from our backyard, to a network that extends cross country, MA POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK is
              a true Ugandan success story that has since expanded countrywide. But far from losing touch 
              with our roots, we have a proud rural and livestock network which continues to grow.</p>
